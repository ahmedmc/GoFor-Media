Absence
If you are going to miss class for any reason, you absolutely must email me: acalder1@my.bcit.ca

Include the word absent in the subject line somewhere so I can find it, should I need to defend your absence from class to my boss.

<p>Pre-requisite
In order to have signed up for this course, you must have either:

completed COMP 1850 with a passing grade, or;
certified that you understand the following concepts
If you are taking this course and do not understand the basics of the following, you should contact Joanne Atha as soon as possible and switch to COMP 1850.
Here is what I expect you will know already:
HTML
You should know how HTML works and how to markup a basic page.
CSS
You should have an introductory understanding of what CSS is and how it works. IDs, Classes, Elements. Beyond that we will be learning in this course.
FTP
You should know how to log into an FTP server and upload/download files. If you don’t know how to do this at all, you will need to learn this immediately.
My expectation
I am the instructor for 1950 and, as such, I get to set the rules. Think of me like your boss. Here are the rules I have for this course

File/Folder Names
While it is technically possible, I do not want any capital letters or spaces in your file or folder names. Special Characters (those characters over the numbers on your keyboard) just won’t work.
Student Pages
The student pages are located at: students.thenet.ca/(student_name) Notice that there is no www at the front. More detail on student pages.
Course web site
You will set up a course web site for COMP 1950 and will maintain it each week. Homework, in-class assignments and any exercises should be on your course web site. In order to get any feedback, your assignments must be completed on time. Otherwise I simply do not have the time to mark late homewok.
Navigation
Please try to make things as easy to find as possible
A simple reminder
This course is about Web Development. This means you should conduct yourself as Web Developers! Think about what you are creating and how it would/could/should be viewed by others.</p>
